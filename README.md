## **Wait... What?!**
**This app won the Swift Student Challenge 2024 as a Distinguished Winner.**  
Can't believe it? **Cry about it.** 🏆😭

Welcome to **FitJourney**, the fitness app designed to make you healthy, happy, and maybe slightly more confused about life (and code). 😅

---

## **What is FitJourney?**
FitJourney is your trusty sidekick on the path to fitness glory! 🏋️‍♀️ It helps you track workouts, smash goals, and pretend you know what a "macro" is. We believe everyone deserves a healthier life... or at least a shot at surviving leg day.

## **Disclaimer 🚨**
Before you dive in:
1. This app was built in **one chaotic week**. ⏰
2. It's **messy**. Like, "left the dishes in the sink for a week" messy. 🥴
3. Expect bugs. Expect *surprises*. Don't expect clean code.  
   - We’re not here to win coding beauty contests. 🏆

---

## **Why so messy?**
Because:
- Deadlines are real. So are snacks.
- We drank too much coffee and used too little sleep.
- Comments? Never met her. 🫠

---

## **Features (that mostly work!)**
- **Workout Tracker** 🏃‍♂️: Because who doesn't love counting squats? 
- **Progress Tracker** 📈: Celebrate tiny wins or cry about giant losses. Your call.

---

## **Known Issues (a.k.a. our app’s “personality”)**
- Some buttons may or may not work. It's like a fitness escape room. 🧩
- Random crashes build character, right? 💥
- Spaghetti code everywhere. Don’t touch it. It might unravel.

---

## **Our Philosophy**
- Life’s a journey. So is debugging.
- Fitness is messy. So is our app.
- We may not be perfect, but we’re perfectly trying. 💁‍♂️

## **Contributing? Good Luck.**
Feel free to dive into the code, but don’t expect a map or instructions. It’s a jungle in there. 🍃 Bring snacks. And patience. 🙏

---

## **Final Words**
Remember: Fitness isn’t about being perfect, and neither is this app. But if it makes you smile while sweating, **mission accomplished**. 🥳

Stay strong, stay healthy, and don’t judge the code too harshly.

💌 **Built with love, coffee, and questionable sleep schedules**

Enjoy the chaos. 🌟
